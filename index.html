	<h1>Our trip to Romania</h1>
	<h3>August 23</h3>
	<h2>Highlights</h2>
	<p>Hi, I am Maayan. <br/>Last August my family had a great trip time in Romania.
	<br/>We truveled me, my husband Shlomi, and our cute children: 
	<br/>Ayala (10.5), Ori (10.5), Dvir (9) and Elad (3.5).
	<br/>For the children it was the first time abroad, so it was such an exited experience for them.
	<br/>Here are some of the best recommended places we visited:
	<h3>Herastrau park</h3>
	A big park in Bucharest full of gardens around a beautiful lake.
	<br/>We enjoyed a half a day walking, sailing a rawboat and playing around the park.

	<h3>Sinaia cable car</h3>
	<p>Sinaia is a town and a mountain resort in Romania, far about 2 hours driving from Bucharest.
	<br/>In this beautiful pastoral place we took two cable cars, to the summit of 2050m height, 
	<br/>and enjoyed the way up and the wonderful view on top.</p>
